    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The Ace editor is an embeddable javascript editor, frequently used in webapps which evaluate some user-supplied code.
      It has language-specific modes which help guide the user towards supplying syntacticaly-valid input.
      These modes are mostly built to provide feedback about lexical consistency (e.g. spelling of keywords) and have piecemeal support for grammatical constraints (does the function name follow the keyword function).
      This document describes the process for constructing a "Santa" ACE editor mode which provides validating, grammar-based editor feedback.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section id="santaMode">
      <h2>Santa mode</h2>
      <p>
        The "Santa" mode is so-named because
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything is styled, so it tends to light up like a Christmas tree.</li>
        <li>It flags grammatically invalid input; i.e. it knows if you've been bad or good.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This provides a user with highlighting feedback at the point of error, greatly reducing the searching around that users typically perform in an unfamiliar or complex language.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="aceStateMachine">
      <h2>Ace state machine</h2>
      <p>
        The Ace editor's syntax highlighting is managed by <code>modes</code> which are typically split across to files: <code>lib/ace/mode/FOO.js</code> and <code>lib/ace/mode/FOO_highlight_rules.js</code>.
        These construct a state machine which the editor traverses in response to user input.
        Each rule in the state machine has an associated <code>token</code> which the editor uses to markup the DOM in the HTML editor.
        For a token "foo", the markup will include a span with the class "ace-foo".
      </p>
      <p>
        The state machine maps production names to lists of rules.
        Each rule maps a lexical pattern to a token and a state transition.
        During execution ("tokenization" in the ACE API), it primarily uses three rule attributes to capture the lexical pattern, the associated class name, and the next state to go to.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
PRODUCTION_NAME: [
  {
    regexp: "PATTERN",
    token: "TOKEN" || onMatch: function (value, currentState, stack, line) => TOKEN,
    next: "PRODUCTION_NAME" || next: function (currentState, stack) => PRODUCTION_NAME
  }
]
      </pre>
      <p>
        For both the <code>onMatch</code> and <code>next</code> functions, the <code>this</code> parameter is the surrounding rule.
        <code>line</code> is the entire line in the editor and <code>value</code> is the portion matched by the pattern.
        <code>currentState</code> is a production name and the stack is an arbitrary list that the functions may manipulate.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <section id="parserAnalog">
        <h3>Parser analog</h3>
        <p>
          In principle, this is enough to construct an LR(1) parser which shifts tokens matched by the rule patterns and pops the stack to reduce to a computed state.
          The patterns associated with each rule in a production provide are effectively a lexer.
          While a lexer like Bison will accept the longest match when more than one pattern could match, the rules in a production must be ordered to accept the preferred pattern.
          Another difference is that where typical lexers require explicit control from the parser to switch state, the patterns in each state's list of rules creates a novel lexer state.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="construction">
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>
          To build a state machine, you typically extend an existing mode.
          If there's no more specific mode, as there probably won't be for modes built from a grammar, you fall back to <code>TextHighlightRules</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example javascript">
const TextHighlightRules = require("./text_highlight_rules").TextHighlightRules;
oop.inherits(ShExCHighlightRules, TextHighlightRules);
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code>this.$rules</code> is a state machine with at least a <code>start</code> element:
        </p>
        <pre class="example javascript">
this.$rules = {
  start: [
    ... e.g. { token: "constant.string", regex: /"/, next: "myString" }
  ],
  myString: [ ... ],
  ...
}
        </pre>
        <p>
          The ace code also calls the elements of those arrays <code>rules</code> so here I will paradoxically refer to <code>this.$rules</code> as the <code>productions</code>, i.e. it maps a state name to a rule list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The productions language used to construct the state machine is more expressive than those navigated during tokenization.
          <code>this.normalizeRules()</code> lightly pre-processes the productions, mapping this richer state machine language to the simple one described above in <a href="#aceStateMachine">§ Ace state machine</a>.
          This affords the author several conveniences when authoring state machines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>nested arrays</em>: Rule lists containing rule lists (containing rule lists, etc.):
            <pre class="example javascript">
start: [
  { token: "constant.language", regex: /&lt;/, next: "myURL" }
  [ [ { token: "constant.string", regex: /"/, next: "myString" } ] ]
],
            </pre>
            will get flattened out into a simple rule list for the current production.
            This frees up generator functions to return any mixture of rules and arrays rules, so long as the outer production member is an array.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>include</em>: If the rule is a simple string (e.g. "#comments"), or if it's an object with an <code>include</code> member:
            <pre class="example javascript">
{ include: "#comments" }
            </pre>
            , inject the referenced rules into the current production.
            The <code>include</code> member may also be an array, in which case all of the members will be injected into the current production.
            Perversely, this even allows <code>{ include: ["foo", ["bar"] ] }</code> as ES6 permits <code>({a:1, b:2})[["b"]]</code> (that evaluates to 2).
          </li>
          <li>
            <em><code>.push: ...</code> and <code>.next: "pop"</code> directives</em>: These are implemented as <code>.next</code> function calls to be executed when a rule is matched.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>invent productions for nested <code>.next</code>s and <code>.push</code>s</em>: A rule's <code>.next</code> can be a produciton name or a list of rules:
            <pre class="example javascript">
{ somethingWithComments: [
  { token: "comment", regex: /\/\*/, next: [
      { token: "comment", regex: "\\*\\/", next: "somethingWithComments" },
      { defaultToken: "comment", caseInsensitive: true }
  ] }
] }
            </pre>
            These get turned into what are hopefully fresh production names (e.g. <code>comment0</code>) by taking the first string in (<code>.stateName</code>, <code>.token</code>, <code>.token[0]</code>).
            If the <code>.token</code> will give you a conflicting or hard-to-read (for debugging) production name, add a distinctive <code>.stateName</code> to the containing rule.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>translate <code>{ start: S, end: E, next: [ L ] }</code> to a gosub</em>: For example:
            <pre class="example javascript">
start:
  { token : "string", start : '"', end : '"|$', next: [
    {token: "constant.language.escape", regex: /\\([tbrf'"n])/},
    {token: "invalid", regex: /\\./}
  ] }
            </pre>
            is transformed to:
            <pre class="example javascript">
"start": [
  { regex: "\"", token : "string.start", next: pushState } // token + ".start"
],
"string.start": [
  { regex: /\\([tbrf'"n])/, token: "constant.language.escape" }
  { regex: /\\./, token: "invalid" }
  { defaultToken: "string" }
  { regex: ""|$", token: "string.end", next: popState } // token + ".end"
]
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>promote nested <code>.rules</code> to top-level</em>: If there's a <code>.rules</code> object, for each <code>(KEY, [MEMBERS])</code>, append MEMBERS to rules[KEY].
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>call <code>this.createKeywordMapper(rule.keywordMap, rule.defaultToken || "text", rule.caseInsensitive)</code> on <code>keywordMap</code> members</em>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="almostLRParser">
        <h3>Almost LR parser</h3>
        <p>
          Because the Ace engine isn't producing an AST, we don't need to reduce multiple shift states to produce a computed result.
          For the purposes of the <a href="http://shex.io/shex-semantics/#shexc">ShEx</a> Santa mode, it was sufficient to augment the state machine generator to include both a gosub and a goto to return to when the nested state popped.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="lexingRules">
      <h3>Lexing rules</h3>
      <p>
        Typical lexers are responsible for tokenizing and skipping whitespace and comments.
        The Ace parser is different for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular expressions skipping whitespace and all comment forms would be bloated and difficult to maintain.</li>
        <li>Most syntax highlighters mark up comments rather than skipping over them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ShExC Santa mode follows a convention that all grammar states manifest in top-level productions and all tokens are represented as nested <code>.next</code> or <code>.push</code> rules.
        This makes it easy to iterate over the productions and prepend comment rules in them.
        This must be done before calling <code>this.normalizeRules()</code> as it will create top-level rules for all nested rules.
        A <code>noCommentList</code> excluded some states from having embedded comment rules:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
const noCommentList = ["start", "regex", "regex_character_class"]
Object.keys(this.$rules)
  .filter(name => noCommentList.indexOf(name) === -1)
  .forEach(name => addComments(this.$rules[name]))
this.normalizeRules()
      </pre>
      <p>
        It's tempting to align the highlight_rules state names with productions in your grammar.
        Since the tokenizer has <code>start</code> hard-coded as a start state (and where to go in case of missing production), you must automatically transition to your top grammar state; in the ShExC case, that was <code>shexDoc</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
        start: [ { regex: /(?:)/, next: "shexDoc" } ]
      </pre>
      <p>
        Since the <code>testBlockComment</code> function in <code>highlight_rules_test.js</code> expects that a block comment introduced in the <code>start</code> state will return you to <code>start</code>, your highlight_rules will need to add redunant comments rules to the start state.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="testing">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>
        For any mode (here, called "foo") <code>lib/ace/mode/foo.js</code>, the convention is to place its associated test in <code>lib/ace/mode/foo_test.js</code>.
        This files exports an object like:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
module.exports = {
  const EditSession = require("../edit_session").EditSession;
  const Tokenizer = require("../tokenizer").Tokenizer;
  const FooMode = require("./foo").Mode;
  const assert = require("../test/assertions");

  some: "internal stuff",
  my_internal: function (...) { ... },
  "test: Some Test Description": function () {
    ... assert.equal(expected, go)
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        The Ace test runner will run everything in <code>module.exports</code> that matches <code>/^[>\!]?test/</code>.
        Including this at the bottom allows you to run your test on its own with <code>node --inspect-brk lib/ace/mode/foo_test.js</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
if (typeof module !== "undefined" &amp;&amp; module === require.main) {
  Async.test.testcase(module.exports).exec();
}
      </pre>
      <section id="dynamicTests">
        <h3>Dynamic tests</h3>
        <p>
          Like most language specifications, ShEx includes a suite of <a href="">positive</a> and <a href="">negative</a> syntax tests which amply exercise any parser.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="testingAcceptState">
        <h3>testing the accept state</h3>
        <p>
          Because Ace's state machine doesn't have an explicit accept state, the one can append each test with a symbol only permitted in an outer context.
          The <code>getTokens(i)</code> function used above doesn't report the final production name so we need to determine the production in a somewhat oblique fashion.
          Because ShEx has text that can only appear in the accept state, we could add that text to the input array:
        </p>
        <pre class="example javascript">
const rows = file.data.split(/\n/)
      .concat(["PREFIX qwer: &lt;&gt;"]) // Make sure we end up in the shexDoc production.
        </pre>
        <p>
          This extra text would be rejected if the state machine were left in any state other than the accept state.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="debugging">
      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>
        A frequent error is to transition to a non-existent state.
        When this happens, the tokenizer flags an error and returns to the <code>start</code> state.
        We can add more detail to this error report, which you'll find in <code>lib/ace/tokenizer.js</code> in the <code>getLineTokens()</code> function (line 292 as of July 2019):
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
if (!state) {
  this.reportError(startState + "-&gt;" + currentState + " on "
                   + match[i+1] + ": state doesn't exist for rule "
                   + i + ":" + JSON.stringify(rule), currentState);
      </pre>
      <p>
        Another frequent issue is simply getting lost wondering what state you're in at some point in the text array.
        We can leverage the kitchen-sink demo's [Show token info] option (bottom of the left option list) by appending the state information to each token:
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript">
this.normalizeRules()
// embedStateDebuggingInfo(this.$rules)

function embedStateDebuggingInfo (grammar) {
  Object.values(grammar).forEach(
    rules =>
      rules.forEach(
        rule =>
          rule.onMatch = function (matched, currentState, stack) {
            console.log(this, matched, currentState, stack)
            return this.token + "\n" + currentState + "\n"
                   + "(" + stack.join("|") + ")\n"
                   + JSON.stringify(rule, null, 2)
          }
      )
  )
}
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section id="process">
      <h2>Process overview</h2>
      <p>
        This process describes the creation of the ShExC Ace Santa mode and was largely informed by the <a href="https://ace.c9.io/#nav=higlighter">Ace Syntax Highlighters documentation</a>:

          </ul>
          <p>
            The custom is for the mode file to reference externally-defined highlight rules:
          </p>
          <pre class="example javascript">
            var ShExCHighlightRules = require("./shexc_highlight_rules").ShExCHighlightRules;

            <li><code>lib/ace/mode/_test/text_shexc.txt</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I use the same text in both.
            This would seem to call out for a symlink but that might be problematic for windows users.

              <p>
                If you're iterating on this, especially in the debugger, you can note the module number when your module comes up, e.g. "126 testing: shexc", and then run <code>node --inspect-brk lib/ace/mode/_test/highlight_rules_test.js 125</code> (note n - 1).

        The ShExC Santa mode was hand-built by examining LALR(1) state tables to see which inputs were required at which point.
        It would be fun and useful to create a set of semantic actions in Jison or Antlr to automatically construct the state table automatically.
        Here's a strawman based on part of the <a href="https://shexspec.github.io/spec/#shexc">ShExC syntax</a>:
      </p>
      <pre>
          PNAME_NS         {PN_PREFIX}? ':'
          …
          IRIREF           '&lt;' ([^\u0000-\u0020&lt;&gt;\"{}|^`\\] | {UCHAR})* '&gt;'
          %%
          {IRIREF}         "constant.language";
          {PNAME_NS}       "constant.library";
          %%

        In this strawman, terminals return ace tokens (i.e. CSS classes) and rules that invokes terminals can append tokens.
        If anyone wants to work with me on this (hint <a href="https://github.com/GerHobbelt">Ger Hobbelt</a>), let me know with an issue.
        Once that works, we can use it to more efficiently create a Santa mode for SPARQL.

      <h3>Minutia</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>made this demo work with require.js or Ace's variant</li>
        <li>enable the kitchen_sink demo's TokenTooltip</li>
        <li>come up with some useful <a href="https://cloud9-sdk.readme.io/docs/snippets">TAB-completion templates</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Again, help would be appreciated as I know nothing about require.js.
